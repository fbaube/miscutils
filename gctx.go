// be passed as the first argument to func calls, and
// 2) It should contain only request-scoped data.
// But we won't abide by those rules for Context because
// 1) We only use it for cancellation, and
// 2) We want zero-argument method calls, and
// 3) We also store data that is NOT request-scoped.
